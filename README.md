# BGP_Traffic_Generation_Comparision
Synthetic BGP traffic generation and evaluation for anomaly detection. Implements a consensus-based labeling pipeline on RIPE RIS data, benchmarks different generators (SMOTE, Copula, GANs, Scapy), and evaluates fidelity and detection utility under cross-collector and cross-incident distribution shifts.
